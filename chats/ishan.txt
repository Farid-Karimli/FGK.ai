[9/12/23, 13:23:52] FGK: Hey Ishan were you able to create your project and configure the permissions for 561?
[9/12/23, 13:26:32] Ishan Ranjan: Oh yeah I was
[9/12/23, 13:26:54] Ishan Ranjan: Creating the project is simple, gcloud has instructions for it
[9/12/23, 13:26:54] FGK: Did you create it under the bu organization
[9/12/23, 13:26:58] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah
[9/12/23, 13:27:01] FGK: Cuz I did and it worked fone
[9/12/23, 13:27:02] FGK: Fine
[9/12/23, 13:27:15] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah it did for me too
[9/12/23, 13:27:19] FGK: But apparently some people did that but cant give permissions
[9/12/23, 13:27:22] FGK: Interesting lol
[9/12/23, 13:27:31] Ishan Ranjan: Did you look at IAM?
[9/12/23, 13:27:38] FGK: I did yeah
[9/12/23, 13:27:39] Ishan Ranjan: I think he still might be updating access
[9/12/23, 13:27:40] FGK: It only worked
[9/12/23, 13:27:48] FGK: After I explicitly created a project
[9/12/23, 13:27:53] FGK: Under the bu organization
[9/12/23, 13:27:55] Ishan Ranjan: Oh yeah you need to do that first

[9/25/23, 15:09:53] FGK: insane

[9/25/23, 15:11:28] Ishan Ranjan: and pray to god
[9/25/23, 15:11:31] Ishan Ranjan: it takes less than 15
[9/25/23, 15:11:40] FGK: 🤣🤣
[9/25/23, 15:17:06] FGK: thats fire
[9/25/23, 15:24:44] Ishan Ranjan: wait wdym the copying took me literally 3 mins
[9/25/23, 15:24:54] Ishan Ranjan: what command did you use lol
[9/25/23, 15:24:56] FGK: Where are you copying from
[9/25/23, 15:25:00] Ishan Ranjan: local to gcloud
[9/25/23, 15:25:02] FGK: Did u make the files on the shell?
[9/25/23, 15:25:08] Ishan Ranjan: made files on local
[9/25/23, 15:25:12] FGK: Yeah same
[9/25/23, 15:25:16] FGK: Took me a long ass time
[9/25/23, 15:25:18] Ishan Ranjan: then gcloud storage cp to bucket
[9/25/23, 15:25:20] FGK: 10k files?
[9/25/23, 15:25:30] FGK: I uploaded straight to bucket
[9/25/23, 15:25:32] FGK: Using Python
[9/25/23, 15:26:06] Ishan Ranjan: oh i did
[9/25/23, 15:26:13] Ishan Ranjan: gcloud storage cp *.html  gs://bu-ds561-iranjan-hw2
[9/25/23, 15:26:15] Ishan Ranjan: much faster
[9/25/23, 15:26:18] Ishan Ranjan: xD
[9/25/23, 15:26:18] FGK: I see
[9/25/23, 15:26:23] FGK: Didnt know that lmao
[9/25/23, 15:26:31] FGK: I just used a for loop 💀
[9/25/23, 15:26:32] Ishan Ranjan: yeah just copied the command from hw1
[9/25/23, 15:26:35] Ishan Ranjan: oh LOL
[9/25/23, 15:26:38] FGK: 10k iterations lmao
[9/25/23, 15:26:40] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that is gonna take a while
[9/25/23, 15:27:32] Ishan Ranjan: command line is gonna be your friend in cloud computing lol
[9/25/23, 17:16:31] Ishan Ranjan: yeah we gon have to use an adjacency matrix for 561
[9/25/23, 17:16:32] Ishan Ranjan: sadge
[9/25/23, 17:16:37] Ishan Ranjan: cause networkx does the hw for you
[9/25/23, 17:47:05] FGK: We cant use networkx??
[9/25/23, 18:02:38] FGK: My guy
[9/25/23, 18:03:09] Ishan Ranjan: Or at least was talking to a couple or CS tryhard and they scoffed at it
[9/25/23, 18:03:11] Ishan Ranjan: Lmao
[9/25/23, 18:03:22] Ishan Ranjan: But from what I’ve seen adjacency matrix can also work
[9/25/23, 18:03:29] Ishan Ranjan: Cause there are no limits on memory usage
[9/25/23, 18:03:36] FGK: Yeah but if we’re allowed to use networkx
[9/25/23, 18:03:38] FGK: Why not
[9/25/23, 18:03:43] FGK: More efficient
[9/25/23, 18:03:45] FGK: And its just smart
[9/25/23, 18:03:51] Ishan Ranjan: Hm true
[9/25/23, 18:04:10] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah I’d post on piazza asking if we can use it
[9/25/23, 18:04:28] FGK: R u doing that or u want me to
[9/25/23, 18:07:07] Ishan Ranjan: I was gonna use adjacancy matrix so
[9/25/23, 18:07:10] Ishan Ranjan: if you wanna go for it
[9/25/23, 18:07:50] Ishan Ranjan: I did ask him about using gcfuse or cloud storage client in office hours tho and he did say that use the python client (the google-cloud-storage one)
[9/25/23, 18:07:58] Ishan Ranjan: for accessing your bucket
[9/25/23, 18:08:05] FGK: Yeah thats what I do
[9/25/23, 18:08:21] FGK: Im guessing u didnt ask him about networkx
[9/25/23, 18:08:26] Ishan Ranjan: yeeeep i forgot
[9/25/23, 18:08:35] FGK: Lmao
[9/25/23, 18:08:53] Ishan Ranjan: speaking of i gotta email micah about building access
[9/25/23, 18:09:00] Ishan Ranjan: cause i cant get up there anymore
[9/25/23, 18:09:04] Ishan Ranjan: to just go ask him again
[9/25/23, 18:09:39] FGK: Even after tapping ur card?
[9/25/23, 18:13:16] FGK: But then
[9/25/23, 18:13:19] FGK: how are you gonna visualize
[9/25/23, 18:13:21] FGK: the graph
[9/25/23, 18:13:35] FGK: Networx lets u do that with a function call
‎[9/25/23, 18:13:50] Ishan Ranjan: ‎image omitted
[9/25/23, 18:13:52] FGK: The code to do that manually is gonna be nuts
[9/25/23, 18:13:54] Ishan Ranjan: hm yeah
[9/25/23, 18:14:00] Ishan Ranjan: actually true
[9/25/23, 18:14:09] Ishan Ranjan: we could just use networkx to create the graph
[9/25/23, 18:14:14] FGK: yeah
[9/25/23, 18:14:18] Ishan Ranjan: but then just manually implement the pagerank algo
[9/25/23, 18:14:21] Ishan Ranjan: is that what you did
[9/25/23, 18:14:25] FGK: Yeah
[9/25/23, 18:14:28] Ishan Ranjan: gotcha
[9/25/23, 18:14:28] FGK: Its just giving me an error
[9/25/23, 18:14:35] FGK: cuz a link can have no outgoing links
[9/25/23, 18:14:38] FGK: a file***8
[9/25/23, 18:14:43] FGK: a file ***
[9/25/23, 18:14:52] FGK: division by zero occurs
[9/25/23, 18:15:06] Ishan Ranjan: hmmmm true
[9/25/23, 18:15:25] FGK: Wait I swear the hw file said visualize the graph
[9/25/23, 18:15:28] FGK: it doesnt say that
[9/25/23, 18:15:55] FGK: and yeah the file says to compute the pagerank score twice
[9/25/23, 18:16:01] FGK: second being the original algorithm
[9/25/23, 18:16:42] Ishan Ranjan: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21507375/how-does-pageranking-algorithm-deal-with-webpage-without-outbound-links
[9/25/23, 18:16:45] Ishan Ranjan: i guess yeah
[9/25/23, 18:17:04] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that is true with the original algorithm a page with no outgoing links should error out
[9/25/23, 18:18:05] Ishan Ranjan: from what i’m seeing you have to delete these from your graph
[9/25/23, 18:18:36] FGK: Yeah I guess so

[9/25/23, 18:25:04] FGK: and the prof said we gotta use our own code
[9/25/23, 18:25:07] FGK: for gods sake
[9/25/23, 18:35:20] Ishan Ranjan: granted in the actual hw assignment it says nothing about visualization
[9/25/23, 18:35:28] Ishan Ranjan: so i think adjacency matrix should be fine

[11/5/23, 12:47:15] Ishan Ranjan: My 100k requests for 561 are running rn lmao I was gonna finish that today
[11/5/23, 12:47:29] Ishan Ranjan: Hm we should converge on some sources and then like maybe peer review
[11/5/23, 12:47:33] Ishan Ranjan: So we don’t each get shafted
[11/5/23, 12:47:45] Ishan Ranjan: I’m also gonna finish it off and get to office hours for her to review it
[11/5/23, 12:47:47] FGK: Yeah sounds good
[11/5/23, 12:47:56] FGK: Bet I’ll do that too then
[11/5/23, 12:48:57] Ishan Ranjan: Sounds good we can meet later in the week for that then xD
[11/5/23, 12:49:00] Ishan Ranjan: Imma just grind 561
[11/5/23, 12:49:12] FGK: Yep sounds good lol
[11/5/23, 14:36:38] Ishan Ranjan: wait btw for prompts are you like focusing on racial and political bias
[11/5/23, 14:36:59] FGK: Mostly political so far
[11/5/23, 14:37:00] FGK: Yeah
‎[11/5/23, 14:37:13] FGK: ‎image omitted
[11/5/23, 15:15:49] FGK: What do you think
[11/5/23, 15:17:19] Ishan Ranjan: ok hm could you put these in a doc
[11/5/23, 15:17:29] FGK: Sure
[11/5/23, 15:17:32] Ishan Ranjan: we could just work on em together then yeah
[11/5/23, 15:17:45] Ishan Ranjan: good premises, we could add follow-ups and make some of these more specific
[11/5/23, 15:17:56] Ishan Ranjan: we could also talk with alison during OO for feedback
[11/5/23, 15:18:07] FGK: Sounds good
[11/5/23, 15:33:26] FGK: Shared ut
[11/5/23, 15:33:29] FGK: It*
[11/5/23, 15:33:35] FGK: I feel like there’s more room for analysis
[11/5/23, 15:33:37] Ishan Ranjan: bet
[11/5/23, 15:33:44] FGK: With the image generators
[11/5/23, 15:33:44] Ishan Ranjan: yeah ill look thru and add
[11/5/23, 15:33:55] FGK: Than the textual models
[11/5/23, 15:44:17] Ishan Ranjan: That’s true yeah
[11/5/23, 15:44:17] Ishan Ranjan: It’s gonna be a little non political with the textual ones I feel
[11/5/23, 15:44:33] FGK: Yeah I can't make it say smth stupid
[11/5/23, 15:44:48] FGK: Like I saw someone ask about the israel Palestine conflict online
[11/5/23, 15:44:49] Ishan Ranjan: that’s why maybe using followups would work but
[11/5/23, 15:44:51] Ishan Ranjan: yeah
[11/5/23, 15:44:59] FGK: and it basically said that Israel has a right to self-defense
[11/5/23, 15:45:09] FGK: but for Palestine it basically said  "its tricky"
[11/5/23, 15:45:26] FGK: But now that I am testing it it just says both have the right
[11/5/23, 15:45:38] FGK: and that its a highly debated, complex topic that depends on many factors
[11/5/23, 15:54:10] Ishan Ranjan: True but like you kinda have to edge it to make it pick one
[11/5/23, 16:20:19] FGK: I also shared a folder with you
[11/5/23, 16:20:25] FGK: Contains the results of my prompts
[11/5/23, 16:20:27] FGK: on the models
[11/5/23, 16:43:39] FGK: I’m trying out other text to image models
[11/5/23, 16:43:43] FGK: They’re so ass 💀
[11/5/23, 16:45:43] Ishan Ranjan: Lmaoooo
[11/5/23, 17:00:28] FGK: I feel like I have good prompts for political bias
[11/5/23, 17:00:52] FGK: If you have suggestions for prompts that can generate racial bias, lmk
[11/5/23, 17:01:03] FGK: And I’ll test them and start writing a draft report thing
[11/5/23, 17:22:01] Ishan Ranjan: dude the pictures are lw fire
[11/5/23, 17:22:09] Ishan Ranjan: i love how they were like yeah riot? french
[11/5/23, 17:22:14] FGK: 🤣🤣🤣
[11/5/23, 17:24:11] Ishan Ranjan: for the visual prompts, lets like add some stuff like “waiter” or “butler” or something like
[11/5/23, 17:24:21] Ishan Ranjan: or "gangster"
[11/5/23, 17:31:30] FGK: Thats good
[11/5/23, 20:21:01] FGK: Wya
[11/5/23, 20:34:45] Ishan Ranjan: We walkin over rn
[11/5/23, 20:34:54] Ishan Ranjan: Be there in 5
[11/5/23, 20:40:28] FGK: Kitchen closes at 9 today lmao
[11/5/23, 20:40:37] Ishan Ranjan: Oooo
[11/5/23, 20:40:46] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah we 2 mins away
[11/7/23, 14:29:03] FGK: Hi Samuel, 
This is Farid, your lab TA. **Add smtn about "I am writing to you about xxxx** Today was the second time you came to the lab more than 20 minutes late. I let it go the first time, thinking any number of things could have happened, it's 8 am after all. ** Maybe change this to like, I understand that the lab is at 8 am and can be slightly inconvenient, which is why I was willing to let it go the first time.**
**However, I would like to remind you that punctuality is a part of your lab attendance grade, if you come to the next labs....****
I'm willing to let it go this time again, but not anymore. If you come to the next labs more than 15 minutes late, I will not be counting your attendance. It is very unfair to people that have been there since 8. **Instead of unfair would write like: Our course staff as well as your fellow students aim to be punctual and professional 
The policy is that students that attend and are active during labs get full attendance credit for that lab. While I don't force students to be very active, I expect that they come on time and stay for the whole lab. I think that is very reasonable. If you find yourself struggling to wake up for the 8am lab, you have the option of going to a different lab. I can provide you with details if you'd like. Otherwise, I ask you to please try to come to the lab on time (or 5-10 mins late, that is fine). 
-- 
Thank you, Farid
[11/7/23, 14:34:48] Ishan Ranjan: Hi Samuel, 

This is Farid, your lab TA. I am writing to you about your attendance in CS111 lab sections. Today was the second time you came to the lab more than 20 minutes late. I understand that the lab is at 8 am and can be inconvenient, which is why I was willing to let it go the first time you were late. However, I just wanted to remind you that punctuality is a part of your lab attendance grade, if you come to the next labs more than 15 minutes late, I will not be counting your attendance. 

Our course staff as well as your fellow students aim to be as professional as possible (which includes punctuality). It is unfair to the rest of the students in the course to simply show up 20 minutes late and expect to have the same lab attendance grade as those who have been there since 8 AM.

I would like to kindly remind you once again that the policy is that students that attend and are active during labs get full attendance credit for that lab. While I don't force students to be very active, I expect that they come on time and stay for the whole lab. I think that is reasonable. 

If you find yourself struggling to wake up for the 8am lab, you have the option of going to a different lab. I can provide you with details if you'd like. Otherwise, I ask you to please try to come to the lab on time (or 5-10 mins late, that is fine).

You are welcome to share a list of papers to review, and to discuss the reading generally, but the annotations should be done independently. I also request that each partner have 2-3 papers that the other partner did not review."

[12/10/23, 09:53:34] Ishan Ranjan: ye
[12/10/23, 10:22:50] FGK: You said you’ll start on Thursday, and the document is still empty. Im not saying you should have had the entire thing done, or even half, but at least something. I know we got a lot of other work, but we gonna get something going now. Our thing is very fragmented rn.
[12/10/23, 10:23:39] FGK: And I’m not saying only you work on the report, we obviously will work together but we divided tasks long ago
[12/10/23, 10:24:59] FGK: Do you wanna divide the report rn? I can take the methods, the results and create the timeline figures.
[12/10/23, 10:50:52] Ishan Ranjan: It is, I was just gonna grind most of it out today but so it’d be easier for us to get it done by Monday, just tryna wrap a lot of things up last minute from my end
[12/10/23, 10:51:19] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah if you could take the results and timeline figures that would be great, I can finish off the rest
[12/10/23, 10:51:25] Ishan Ranjan: Since you worked the most with those
[12/10/23, 10:51:28] FGK: You got it

[12/11/23, 20:56:14] Ishan Ranjan: nah i got the methods and results so you good
[12/11/23, 20:56:20] FGK: You can just ask for pointers
[12/11/23, 20:56:26] Ishan Ranjan: for this ye
[12/11/23, 20:56:32] FGK: And I can give you what questions I have
[12/11/23, 20:56:34] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that's what i was gonna do mainly
[12/11/23, 20:56:42] Ishan Ranjan: sure thing just list em out here or on the doc
[12/11/23, 20:56:48] FGK: Gotchu
[12/11/23, 21:02:28] FGK: So essentially if you could show her our results
[12/11/23, 21:02:34] FGK: Like the most representative examples
[12/11/23, 21:02:43] FGK: And ask if she thinks this is robuts enough
[12/11/23, 21:03:21] FGK: And that I was thinking of a quantitative approach - calculating polarity scores of text responses on Trump vs Biden
[12/11/23, 21:03:41] FGK: for example
[12/11/23, 21:36:06] Ishan Ranjan: ah yeah we could ask that
[12/11/23, 21:36:10] Ishan Ranjan: good point
[12/11/23, 21:36:33] FGK: So we’d have a qualitative and a quantitative approach
[12/11/23, 21:50:24] Ishan Ranjan: yep
[12/11/23, 21:50:41] Ishan Ranjan: could we potentially use sentiment as well
[12/11/23, 21:50:55] Ishan Ranjan: and also can we make a GitHub repo for all of this too
[12/11/23, 21:51:04] Ishan Ranjan: instead of Gdrive
[12/11/23, 22:36:34] FGK: Sure
[12/11/23, 22:39:01] Ishan Ranjan: sounds good
[12/11/23, 22:56:40] FGK: I’m adding more tests
[12/11/23, 22:56:42] FGK: to the drtive
[12/11/23, 22:56:44] FGK: drive*
[12/11/23, 23:51:04] FGK: Thats what I was talking about
[12/11/23, 23:51:13] FGK: examine the positive or negative sentiment
[12/11/23, 23:51:18] FGK: of a given response to a prompt
[12/12/23, 00:08:01] FGK: Also you say "medical advice based on race"
[12/12/23, 00:08:05] FGK: I'm not sure what that means lmao
[12/12/23, 00:08:17] FGK: Cuz we got no prompts like that
[12/12/23, 09:53:13] Ishan Ranjan: oh yeah true
[12/12/23, 09:53:45] Ishan Ranjan: i guess like i could just make that more into the previous work where like “oh it’s been shown to have bias in other fields so we were interested in bias in general” kinda thing
[12/12/23, 09:53:56] FGK: Sure
[12/12/23, 09:53:58] FGK: You do you gango
[12/12/23, 09:54:12] Ishan Ranjan: bet

[12/12/23, 14:20:57] FGK: I can do more testing
[12/12/23, 14:21:11] FGK: Get more results and do the polarity score thing

[12/13/23, 11:31:57] FGK: Yeah make sure you mention the approaches we tried
[12/13/23, 11:32:09] FGK: our prompts, role playing, text completion
