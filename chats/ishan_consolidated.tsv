1; hey ishan were you able to create your project and configure the permissions for 561?
3; did you create it under the bu organization
5; cuz i did and it worked fone fine
7; but apparently some people did that but cant give permissions interesting lol
11; it only worked after i explicitly created a project under the bu organization
13; okay just wanted to make sure cuz the recent piazza post got me concerned
15; lol hey you have any idea what you're gonna do for the 587 project
17; i was thinking that too
19; lots of room for smth interesting we can team up if you'd like that
21; great we can discuss more tomorrow i was gonna brainstorm rn
23; if you need a ride lmk we can go get drinks together as well for tonight
25; there’s blanchards on harvard ave
35; can we meet together? i thought it was individually we meeting with the 587 professor tmrw at 3? lmk if u want a different time
39; are you free this sunday night
41; its my birthday i wanna gather people to go celebrate nothing too crazy considering its a sunday
45; not sure abt that rn
47; love it sojuba has a 2 hour limit for each party but idk how much they’ll enforce it on a sunday night
49; im here for the meeting with the prof wya rn
55; oh the lecture lmao its alright same energy as ours
57; yeah and these guys behind us annoying af
59; just talking while he's talking in the beginning was annoying but its no big deal lol interesting how he's limiting you to climate
61; yep like in lecture today he showed us the graph of the s&p500 and asked why theres a dip on wednesday
63; and we discussed the fed holding interest rates lmao bro knows his shit
69; agreed did u get the us defense project???
71; work from home lmao i put down carmen after as well
73; its aight though they probably didnt want non us people on that
79; aint no way thats insane
81; feeling better abt it now then lmao
85; i think so yeah
87; lmao are you done with the homework?
91; the file upload was like a good 20-30 mins insane
103; where are you copying from
105; did u make the files on the shell?
107; yeah same took me a long ass time
109; 10k files? i uploaded straight to bucket using python
111; i see didnt know that lmao i just used a for loop
115; we cant use networkx?? my guy
117; yeah but if we’re allowed to use networkx why not more efficient and its just smart
119; r u doing that or u want me to
121; yeah thats what i do im guessing u didnt ask him about networkx
125; even after tapping ur card? but then how are you gonna visualize the graph networx lets u do that with a function call the code to do that manually is gonna be nuts
131; its just giving me an error cuz a link can have no outgoing links a file***8 a file *** division by zero occurs
133; wait i swear the hw file said visualize the graph it doesnt say that and yeah the file says to compute the pagerank score twice second being the original algorithm
135; yeah i guess so
137; a student responded to my question
139; okay and the prof said we gotta use our own code for gods sake
141; for some reason i remember it saying lmao i know i know
143; are you running the code locally
145; aight bro my code is running for so long its ridiculous
147; wtf ive never even heard of this thats wild
149; aight my codes been running for 1.5 hours la lmao**
153; this is free then i did this exactly a year ago too
155; wtf is that i read that as sugma
165; i’m running my code and getting the division by 0 error lmao
167; i dont understand how literally makes no sense are u verifying with networkx you mind if we get on a zoom call in a bit to verify
173; some bs is going on in my bucket some files are blank
175; yeah i try to open them and nothing
177; i deleted them and uploading again now
181; u want me to send the link
183; are u just gonna instruct them to run your file

303; yep sounds good lol
305; mostly political so far yeah what do you think
309; sounds good shared ut it* i feel like there’s more room for analysis
311; with the image generators
313; than the textual models
315; yeah i can't make it say smth stupid like i saw someone ask about the israel palestine conflict online
317; and it basically said that israel has a right to self-defense but for palestine it basically said  "its tricky" but now that i am testing it it just says both have the right and that its a highly debated, complex topic that depends on many factors
319; i also shared a folder with you contains the results of my prompts on the models i’m trying out other text to image models they’re so ass
321; i feel like i have good prompts for political bias if you have suggestions for prompts that can generate racial bias, lmk and i’ll test them and start writing a draft report thing

535; aight let me know what you think and feel free to add anything
537; so what’d u think of the presentation
541; are you looking at the presentation lmaooo but this is kinda wrong harmon kardon is the default
543; burmeister or bowers and wilkins is the better option i kinda focused on my part but i guess its both of ours cuz you also tweaked the prompts
545; add some parts that talk about the position paper and what it will include and we good
547; yo what bias in visual models are u talking about or did u test on ur own?
549; i didnt find any bias in the image models
551; like systemic not one off ah gotcha
553; sure who’s taking what i can do background + methods you do the rest?
555; i’ll do the conclusions
561; i believe attendance is mandatory
563; yeah it is hop off bro
569; wow its almost as if two people could have the same name  glazing
571; nope we have our staff meeting tmrw we’ll address it then probably
573; yeah thats good we can say that our findings made us shift directions
575; towards figuring out if ai models have become better at being unbiased did u make the change on the big slide deck? + for which we can create a timeline
583; thats a great idea yo my guy wya
585; let’s do this you do background and motivation i do methods and the second findings slide you also do the first findings slide + takeaways conclusion
587; i do conclusion mb aight bet
589; yeah essentially also take a look at the changes i made small
593; but u started wylin there for a second on communism v capitalism
595; lmaooo yo you wanna get started on drafting our write-up
597; since u said u wanna meet with her on monsay monday
601; yo were u able to figure it out the cloud
603; did u start the final report ???
605; okay i’ll start building my timeline today or tomorrow morning
607; yeah and i’ll write the accompanying discussion for it too for now start with just the introduction and previous work but if u wanna go even further into the test results and examples thats great
609; theres a service account that deployment manager uses give it the owner role u dont see it by default you go to service accounts and check show google provided roles/accounts on the right
611; yeah did you say you wanted to meet with allison tmrw
613; what time? i got two presentations on tuesday gonne have to be you gonna*
615; we gotta get started to show her smth if we’re seeing her before that
617; bro what wtf is slog
621; you said you’ll start on thursday, and the document is still empty. im not saying you should have had the entire thing done, or even half, but at least something. i know we got a lot of other work, but we gonna get something going now. our thing is very fragmented rn. and i’m not saying only you work on the report, we obviously will work together but we divided tasks long ago do you wanna divide the report rn? i can take the methods, the results and create the timeline figures.
625; lol idk fyi i cant make that time
629; do you need anything from me?
631; goddamn we got time till thursday
633; you can just ask for pointers
635; and i can give you what questions i have
637; gotchu so essentially if you could show her our results like the most representative examples and ask if she thinks this is robuts enough and that i was thinking of a quantitative approach - calculating polarity scores of text responses on trump vs biden for example
639; so we’d have a qualitative and a quantitative approach
643; i’m adding more tests to the drtive drive* thats what i was talking about examine the positive or negative sentiment of a given response to a prompt also you say "medical advice based on race" i'm not sure what that means lmao cuz we got no prompts like that
645; sure you do you gango
649; yo theres one more ishan
655; it really is lmao
657; thats wild lmao and we got like 4 questions
659; like that fr fr so for the report are you gonna work on it later today? i wanted to say smth about the findings we can do this
661; you can write like a skeleton of our findings high level overview i can do more testing get more results and do the polarity score thing and we can update accordingly
663; gpt 4 is actually a g refuses to give an opinion ever goddamn
665; bro we both procrastinated so much on this project we could have a much easier time right now but as you know, fuck it we ball
667; so i added what chatgpt outputted its not ideal you can go ahead and just edit it now, making smooth transitions
669; be sure to mention the authors’ methods a lot and how they relate to our methodology
671; you can find those in the bibliographies
673; oh our findings you gotit you mind if i do that by tonight im thinking of doing more testing to make this shit more robust
675; lmaooo this is all you my guy oh maybe we could have these approaches 1. normal prompts
677; 2. role playing those two thats fire what time are we meeting allison tmrw?
679; oh shit aight bet thats good actually gives us more time
681; okay gotchu this is hella nice
683; i like this any other role playing scenarios if you can get like 5 in total that’d be amazing i think
685; bet yo i was working on smth else this evening anything you need from me or smth you’d like me to take over
689; professor wanted some last minute changes lmao
691; ong goddamn chatgpt just cant budge about politic s same with bard
693; im imitating another researcher’s method text completion “i am a republican, in the next election i will be voting for..." “abortion should be ..." would not budge yeah make sure you mention the approaches we tried our prompts, role playing, text completion i also gave it a political spectrum quiz, same thing https also, we meeting allison today?
695; gotchu i gotta meet my research professor at 2
697; gotchu yo stability ai wildin cant lie got some spicy results
699; iamges images yeah the only argument i have for bias in images is that it is just us centric for strictly political prompts the popular ones, chatgpt, stable diffusion and dall-e 2
701; still with my prof are you there rn?
703; okay are u with her
705; it’s the thought that counts you know wya gang
711; left side second floor
715; are you working on the report? yeah they’re super nice
719; bet if you want me to do some shit lmk i can do it after and we verify then submit do we want the sentiment analysis
725; so leave that part blank i’ll fill in later
729; yeah i gotta add to it though
737; u still on the 15th?
743; i started on the sentiment analysis but i'm fucking exhausted i'll finish it tomorrow morning
745; and then we can verify together and submit
747; bet thanks wait llama 2 refused to write a poem about trump but did it for biden
749; yo i was gonna add sentiment results to two more prompts do you think we need to or can we essentially start reviewing and submit i added a bunch of stuff last night take a look
751; lets do 6 yessir
753; ^ take a look at that sentiment table i’m not sure what prompt to use there cuz i wanna like see how it talks about capitalist stuff and communist stuff

773; aight im pretty much done just decided to knock this out i think we’re okay
775; if you could just look it over make sure everything is consistent, like the findings and the discussion and the related work
777; bet lmk if you want me to look at smth i can after 6
779; will do once im home thanks do we really have to just straight grunt work
781; its all in there already i can do it no worries
