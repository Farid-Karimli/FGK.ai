Other:23:52] FGK: Hey Ishan were you able to create your project and configure the permissions for 561?
Other:26:32] Ishan Ranjan: Oh yeah I was
Other:26:54] Ishan Ranjan: Creating the project is simple, gcloud has instructions for it
Other:26:54] FGK: Did you create it under the bu organization
Other:26:58] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah
Other:27:01] FGK: Cuz I did and it worked fone
Other:27:02] FGK: Fine
Other:27:15] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah it did for me too
Other:27:19] FGK: But apparently some people did that but cant give permissions
Other:27:22] FGK: Interesting lol
Other:27:31] Ishan Ranjan: Did you look at IAM?
Other:27:38] FGK: I did yeah
Other:27:39] Ishan Ranjan: I think he still might be updating access
Other:27:40] FGK: It only worked
Other:27:48] FGK: After I explicitly created a project
Other:27:53] FGK: Under the bu organization
Other:27:55] Ishan Ranjan: Oh yeah you need to do that first
Other:28:03] FGK: Okay just wanted to make sure

Other:06:53] Ishan Ranjan: Just starting lol
Other:07:59] FGK: Lmao
Other:08:46] Ishan Ranjan: i mean i created a bucket and the weblinks i must be halfway done already (no im totally not)
Other:08:50] Ishan Ranjan: how long did it take you
Other:09:14] Ishan Ranjan: i looked up will on github and he’s already done :skull:
Other:09:48] FGK: The file upload
Other:09:51] FGK: was like a good 20-30 mins
Other:09:53] FGK: insane
Other:09:58] Ishan Ranjan: for bucket?
Other:10:00] FGK: goddamn
Other:10:00] Ishan Ranjan: sheeeesh
Other:10:01] FGK: yeah
Other:10:17] Ishan Ranjan: was this over bu wifi
Other:10:19] Ishan Ranjan: or at home
Other:10:21] FGK: at home
Other:10:23] FGK: 300mbs
Other:10:24] Ishan Ranjan: fuc
Other:10:27] Ishan Ranjan: i have the same
Other:10:28] Ishan Ranjan: rip
Other:10:32] FGK: lmao
Other:11:26] Ishan Ranjan: bro i just wanna go home, plug my shit into our gigabit internet through an ethernet cable
Other:11:28] Ishan Ranjan: and pray to god
Other:11:31] Ishan Ranjan: it takes less than 15
Other:11:40] FGK: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Other:17:06] FGK: thats fire
Other:24:44] Ishan Ranjan: wait wdym the copying took me literally 3 mins
Other:24:54] Ishan Ranjan: what command did you use lol
Other:24:56] FGK: Where are you copying from
Other:25:00] Ishan Ranjan: local to gcloud
Other:25:02] FGK: Did u make the files on the shell?
Other:25:08] Ishan Ranjan: made files on local
Other:25:12] FGK: Yeah same
Other:25:16] FGK: Took me a long ass time
Other:25:18] Ishan Ranjan: then gcloud storage cp to bucket
Other:25:20] FGK: 10k files?
Other:25:30] FGK: I uploaded straight to bucket
Other:25:32] FGK: Using Python
Other:26:06] Ishan Ranjan: oh i did
Other:26:13] Ishan Ranjan: gcloud storage cp *.html  gs://bu-ds561-iranjan-hw2
Other:26:15] Ishan Ranjan: much faster
Other:26:18] Ishan Ranjan: xD
Other:26:18] FGK: I see
Other:26:23] FGK: Didnt know that lmao
Other:26:31] FGK: I just used a for loop :skull:
Other:26:32] Ishan Ranjan: yeah just copied the command from hw1
Other:26:35] Ishan Ranjan: oh LOL
Other:26:38] FGK: 10k iterations lmao
Other:26:40] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that is gonna take a while
Other:27:32] Ishan Ranjan: command line is gonna be your friend in cloud computing lol
Other:16:31] Ishan Ranjan: yeah we gon have to use an adjacency matrix for 561
Other:16:32] Ishan Ranjan: sadge
Other:16:37] Ishan Ranjan: cause networkx does the hw for you
Other:47:05] FGK: We cant use networkx??
Other:02:38] FGK: My guy
Other:03:09] Ishan Ranjan: Or at least was talking to a couple or CS tryhard and they scoffed at it
Other:03:11] Ishan Ranjan: Lmao
Other:03:22] Ishan Ranjan: But from what I’ve seen adjacency matrix can also work
Other:03:29] Ishan Ranjan: Cause there are no limits on memory usage
Other:03:36] FGK: Yeah but if we’re allowed to use networkx
Other:03:38] FGK: Why not
Other:03:43] FGK: More efficient
Other:03:45] FGK: And its just smart
Other:03:51] Ishan Ranjan: Hm true
Other:04:10] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah I’d post on piazza asking if we can use it
Other:04:28] FGK: R u doing that or u want me to
Other:07:07] Ishan Ranjan: I was gonna use adjacancy matrix so
Other:07:10] Ishan Ranjan: if you wanna go for it
Other:07:50] Ishan Ranjan: I did ask him about using gcfuse or cloud storage client in office hours tho and he did say that use the python client (the google-cloud-storage one)
Other:07:58] Ishan Ranjan: for accessing your bucket
Other:08:05] FGK: Yeah thats what I do
Other:08:21] FGK: Im guessing u didnt ask him about networkx
Other:08:26] Ishan Ranjan: yeeeep i forgot
Other:08:35] FGK: Lmao
Other:08:53] Ishan Ranjan: speaking of i gotta email micah about building access
Other:09:00] Ishan Ranjan: cause i cant get up there anymore
Other:09:04] Ishan Ranjan: to just go ask him again
Other:09:39] FGK: Even after tapping ur card?
Other:13:16] FGK: But then
Other:13:19] FGK: how are you gonna visualize
Other:13:21] FGK: the graph
Other:13:35] FGK: Networx lets u do that with a function call
Other:13:50] Ishan Ranjan: image omitted
Other:13:52] FGK: The code to do that manually is gonna be nuts
Other:13:54] Ishan Ranjan: hm yeah
Other:14:00] Ishan Ranjan: actually true
Other:14:09] Ishan Ranjan: we could just use networkx to create the graph
Other:14:14] FGK: yeah
Other:14:18] Ishan Ranjan: but then just manually implement the pagerank algo
Other:14:21] Ishan Ranjan: is that what you did
Other:14:25] FGK: Yeah
Other:14:28] Ishan Ranjan: gotcha
Other:14:28] FGK: Its just giving me an error
Other:14:35] FGK: cuz a link can have no outgoing links
Other:14:38] FGK: a file***8
Other:14:43] FGK: a file ***
Other:14:52] FGK: division by zero occurs
Other:15:06] Ishan Ranjan: hmmmm true
Other:15:25] FGK: Wait I swear the hw file said visualize the graph
Other:15:28] FGK: it doesnt say that
Other:15:55] FGK: and yeah the file says to compute the pagerank score twice
Other:16:01] FGK: second being the original algorithm
Other:16:42] Ishan Ranjan: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21507375/how-does-pageranking-algorithm-deal-with-webpage-without-outbound-links
Other:16:45] Ishan Ranjan: i guess yeah
Other:17:04] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that is true with the original algorithm a page with no outgoing links should error out
Other:18:05] Ishan Ranjan: from what i’m seeing you have to delete these from your graph
Other:18:36] FGK: Yeah I guess so
Other:18:47] Ishan Ranjan: https://medium.com/@arpanspeaks/handling-dangling-nodes-pagerank-14c31d5b6b62
Other:18:56] Ishan Ranjan: he used networkx here
Other:20:27] FGK: a student responded to my question
Other:20:58] Ishan Ranjan: hm that might have been the guy i talked to
Other:21:09] FGK: okay
Other:25:04] FGK: and the prof said we gotta use our own code
Other:25:07] FGK: for gods sake
Other:35:20] Ishan Ranjan: granted in the actual hw assignment it says nothing about visualization
Other:35:28] Ishan Ranjan: so i think adjacency matrix should be fine
Other:35:32] FGK: for some reason i remember it saying lmao
Other:35:59] Ishan Ranjan: image omitted
Other:36:07] FGK: I know i know
Other:47:13] Ishan Ranjan: lmaoooo
Other:58:21] FGK: Are you running the code locally
Other:19:30] Ishan Ranjan: yeah
Other:19:53] Ishan Ranjan: i am adding a requirements.txt for people to run tho
Other:20:06] Ishan Ranjan: with the bucket being public it should be able to run from anywhere tho
Other:22:14] FGK: Aight
Other:42:30] FGK: Bro my code is running for so long its ridiculous
Other:12:28] Ishan Ranjan: Damn
Other:12:38] Ishan Ranjan: Some ppl used tqdm to show progress lmao
Other:13:24] FGK: wtf
Other:13:28] FGK: ive never even heard of this
Other:13:29] FGK: thats wild
Other:13:48] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah
Other:13:53] Ishan Ranjan: It’s insNe
Other:13:57] Ishan Ranjan: I’m gonna use it
Other:14:04] FGK: Aight
Other:14:10] FGK: my codes been running for 1.5 hours la
Other:14:12] FGK: lmao**
Other:14:22] Ishan Ranjan: Oooof
Other:55:32] Ishan Ranjan: im literally on my slides from undergrad
Other:55:44] FGK: Lmao
Other:55:45] Ishan Ranjan: cause this is how common hierarchical is brought up in bioinformatics
Other:55:53] Ishan Ranjan: this is literally my lab work
Other:55:54] Ishan Ranjan: LOL
Other:56:09] FGK: This is free then
Other:56:18] FGK: I did this exactly a year ago too
Other:56:33] Ishan Ranjan: yeah tbh im wondering why i came to lecture lol

Other:51:17] Ishan Ranjan: wait so for 561
Other:51:21] Ishan Ranjan: and the pagerank stuff
Other:51:31] Ishan Ranjan: for the first iteration what did you set the pagerank values to
Other:53:14] FGK: image omitted
Other:54:03] Ishan Ranjan: gotcha
Other:54:04] Ishan Ranjan: thanks
Other:54:11] FGK: Nw
Other:54:18] Ishan Ranjan: yeah just need to do this otherwise im done
Other:54:29] Ishan Ranjan: using 100 files to test saved my life LOL
Other:54:36] FGK: I’m running my code and getting the division by 0 error lmao
Other:54:36] Ishan Ranjan: idk what that dude is on with threadpoolexecutor
Other:54:39] Ishan Ranjan: oooof
Other:54:47] FGK: I dont understand how literally makes no sense

Other:37:13] FGK: image omitted
Other:15:49] FGK: What do you think
Other:17:19] Ishan Ranjan: ok hm could you put these in a doc
Other:17:29] FGK: Sure
Other:17:32] Ishan Ranjan: we could just work on em together then yeah
Other:17:45] Ishan Ranjan: good premises, we could add follow-ups and make some of these more specific
Other:17:56] Ishan Ranjan: we could also talk with alison during OO for feedback
Other:18:07] FGK: Sounds good
Other:33:26] FGK: Shared ut
Other:33:29] FGK: It*
Other:33:35] FGK: I feel like there’s more room for analysis
Other:33:37] Ishan Ranjan: bet
Other:33:44] FGK: With the image generators
Other:33:44] Ishan Ranjan: yeah ill look thru and add
Other:33:55] FGK: Than the textual models
Other:44:17] Ishan Ranjan: That’s true yeah
Other:44:17] Ishan Ranjan: It’s gonna be a little non political with the textual ones I feel
Other:44:33] FGK: Yeah I can't make it say smth stupid
Other:44:48] FGK: Like I saw someone ask about the israel Palestine conflict online
Other:44:49] Ishan Ranjan: that’s why maybe using followups would work but
Other:44:51] Ishan Ranjan: yeah
Other:44:59] FGK: and it basically said that Israel has a right to self-defense
Other:45:09] FGK: but for Palestine it basically said  "its tricky"
Other:45:26] FGK: But now that I am testing it it just says both have the right
Other:45:38] FGK: and that its a highly debated, complex topic that depends on many factors
Other:54:10] Ishan Ranjan: True but like you kinda have to edge it to make it pick one
Other:20:19] FGK: I also shared a folder with you
Other:20:25] FGK: Contains the results of my prompts
Other:20:27] FGK: on the models
Other:43:39] FGK: I’m trying out other text to image models
Other:43:43] FGK: They’re so ass :skull:
Other:45:43] Ishan Ranjan: Lmaoooo
Other:00:28] FGK: I feel like I have good prompts for political bias
Other:00:52] FGK: If you have suggestions for prompts that can generate racial bias, lmk
Other:01:03] FGK: And I’ll test them and start writing a draft report thing
Other:22:01] Ishan Ranjan: dude the pictures are lw fire
Other:22:09] Ishan Ranjan: i love how they were like yeah riot? french
Other:22:14] FGK: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Other:24:11] Ishan Ranjan: for the visual prompts, lets like add some stuff like “waiter” or “butler” or something like
Other:24:21] Ishan Ranjan: or "gangster"
Other:31:30] FGK: Thats good

Other:41:58] Ishan Ranjan: given how centrist the responses were
Other:42:14] FGK: Yeah thats good
Other:42:27] FGK: We can say that our findings made us shift directions

Other:53:34] Ishan Ranjan: ye
Other:22:50] FGK: You said you’ll start on Thursday, and the document is still empty. Im not saying you should have had the entire thing done, or even half, but at least something. I know we got a lot of other work, but we gonna get something going now. Our thing is very fragmented rn.
Other:23:39] FGK: And I’m not saying only you work on the report, we obviously will work together but we divided tasks long ago
Other:24:59] FGK: Do you wanna divide the report rn? I can take the methods, the results and create the timeline figures.
Other:50:52] Ishan Ranjan: It is, I was just gonna grind most of it out today but so it’d be easier for us to get it done by Monday, just tryna wrap a lot of things up last minute from my end
Other:51:19] Ishan Ranjan: Yeah if you could take the results and timeline figures that would be great, I can finish off the rest
Other:51:25] Ishan Ranjan: Since you worked the most with those
Other:51:28] FGK: You got it
Other:51:32] Ishan Ranjan: Bet

Other:56:20] FGK: You can just ask for pointers
Other:56:26] Ishan Ranjan: for this ye
Other:56:32] FGK: And I can give you what questions I have
Other:56:34] Ishan Ranjan: yeah that's what i was gonna do mainly
Other:56:42] Ishan Ranjan: sure thing just list em out here or on the doc
Other:56:48] FGK: Gotchu
Other:02:28] FGK: So essentially if you could show her our results
Other:02:34] FGK: Like the most representative examples
Other:02:43] FGK: And ask if she thinks this is robuts enough
Other:03:21] FGK: And that I was thinking of a quantitative approach - calculating polarity scores of text responses on Trump vs Biden
Other:03:41] FGK: for example
Other:36:06] Ishan Ranjan: ah yeah we could ask that
Other:36:10] Ishan Ranjan: good point
Other:36:33] FGK: So we’d have a qualitative and a quantitative approach
Other:50:24] Ishan Ranjan: yep
Other:50:41] Ishan Ranjan: could we potentially use sentiment as well
Other:50:55] Ishan Ranjan: and also can we make a GitHub repo for all of this too
Other:51:04] Ishan Ranjan: instead of Gdrive
Other:36:34] FGK: Sure
Other:39:01] Ishan Ranjan: sounds good
Other:56:40] FGK: I’m adding more tests
Other:56:42] FGK: to the drtive
Other:56:44] FGK: drive*
Other:51:04] FGK: Thats what I was talking about
Other:51:13] FGK: examine the positive or negative sentiment
Other:51:18] FGK: of a given response to a prompt
Other:08:01] FGK: Also you say "medical advice based on race"
Other:08:05] FGK: I'm not sure what that means lmao
Other:08:17] FGK: Cuz we got no prompts like that
Other:53:13] Ishan Ranjan: oh yeah true
Other:53:45] Ishan Ranjan: i guess like i could just make that more into the previous work where like “oh it’s been shown to have bias in other fields so we were interested in bias in general” kinda thing
Other:53:56] FGK: Sure
Other:53:58] FGK: You do you gango
Other:54:12] Ishan Ranjan: bet
Other:54:14] Ishan Ranjan: also how did we do

Other:20:51] FGK: High level overview
Other:20:57] FGK: I can do more testing
Other:21:11] FGK: Get more results and do the polarity score thing
Other:21:16] FGK: And we can update accordingly

Other:53:40] FGK: Be sure to mention the authors’ methods
Other:53:41] FGK: a lot
Other:53:50] FGK: and how they relate to our methodology
Other:53:58] Ishan Ranjan: bet, could you also just like bullet point out the main findings
Other:54:06] Ishan Ranjan: and then ill just put them and edit into paragraph form
Other:54:12] FGK: You can find those in the bibliographies
