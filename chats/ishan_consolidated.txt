me: hey ishan were you able to create your project and configure the permissions for 561?
other: oh yeah i was creating the project is simple, gcloud has instructions for it
me: did you create it under the bu organization
other: yeah
me: cuz i did and it worked fone fine
other: yeah it did for me too
me: but apparently some people did that but cant give permissions interesting lol
other: did you look at iam?
me: i did yeah
other: i think he still might be updating access
me: it only worked after i explicitly created a project under the bu organization
other: oh yeah you need to do that first
me: okay just wanted to make sure cuz the recent piazza post got me concerned
other: lmaoo yeah it’s a mood
me: lol hey you have any idea what you're gonna do for the 587 project
other: hm so smtn based on like ai art maybe its a lit review idk yet or maybe an ai generated video
me: i was thinking that too
other: or something idk
me: lots of room for smth interesting we can team up if you'd like that
other: id be down
me: great we can discuss more tomorrow i was gonna brainstorm rn
other: sounds good

me: yeah and these guys behind us annoying af
other: lmao i know them so it be like that

other: true fair yeah theyre friends with my roommates so they prob saw me and sat near lol yeah honestly i kinda wanna do stocks thats so much more interesting
me: yep like in lecture today he showed us the graph of the s&p500 and asked why theres a dip on wednesday
other: oh shit
me: and we discussed the fed holding interest rates lmao bro knows his shit
other: damn haha wait what time is deep learning lecture
me: 3 cas 203
other: aaah gotcha, yeah i feel like people are dead by 5
me: yep
other: 3
me: agreed did u get the us defense project???
other: we did sorry bro which one did you get

other: dude the work from home professor
me: which i understand
other: is goated with connections she knows the obama *obamas a lot of people in government
me: what
other: it’s a good project to get yeah
me: aint no way thats insane
other: jack and i were talking with one of her grad students yeah
me: feeling better abt it now then lmao
other: yeah haha aight just got back you still free to zoom
me: yeah sending link
other: bet how far away are ya wait so for 561 is the github repo supposed to be public or not
me: i think so yeah
other: ok wow based
me: lmao are you done with the homework?
other: just starting lol
me: lmao
other: i mean i created a bucket and the weblinks i must be halfway done already (no im totally not) how long did it take you i looked up will on github and he’s already done
me: the file upload was like a good 20-30 mins insane
other: for bucket?
me: goddamn
other: sheeeesh
me: yeah
other: was this over bu wifi or at home
me: at home 300mbs
other: fuc i have the same rip
me: lmao
other: bro i just wanna go home, plug my shit into our gigabit internet through an ethernet cable and pray to god it takes less than 15
me: thats fire
other: wait wdym the copying took me literally 3 mins what command did you use lol
me: where are you copying from
other: local to gcloud
me: did u make the files on the shell?
other: made files on local
me: yeah same took me a long ass time
other: then gcloud storage cp to bucket
me: 10k files? i uploaded straight to bucket using python
other: oh i did gcloud storage cp *.html  gs much faster xd
me: i see didnt know that lmao i just used a for loop
other: yeah just copied the command from hw1 oh lol
me: 10k iterations lmao
other: yeah that is gonna take a while command line is gonna be your friend in cloud computing lol yeah we gon have to use an adjacency matrix for 561 sadge cause networkx does the hw for you
me: we cant use networkx?? my guy
other: or at least was talking to a couple or cs tryhard and they scoffed at it lmao but from what i’ve seen adjacency matrix can also work cause there are no limits on memory usage
me: yeah but if we’re allowed to use networkx why not more efficient and its just smart
other: hm true yeah i’d post on piazza asking if we can use it
me: r u doing that or u want me to
other: i was gonna use adjacancy matrix so if you wanna go for it i did ask him about using gcfuse or cloud storage client in office hours tho and he did say that use the python client (the google-cloud-storage one) for accessing your bucket
me: yeah thats what i do im guessing u didnt ask him about networkx
other: yeeeep i forgot
me: lmao
other: speaking of i gotta email micah about building access cause i cant get up there anymore to just go ask him again
me: even after tapping ur card? but then how are you gonna visualize the graph networx lets u do that with a function call the code to do that manually is gonna be nuts
other: hm yeah actually true we could just use networkx to create the graph
me: yeah
other: but then just manually implement the pagerank algo is that what you did
me: yeah
other: gotcha
me: its just giving me an error cuz a link can have no outgoing links a file***8 a file *** division by zero occurs
other: hmmmm true
me: wait i swear the hw file said visualize the graph it doesnt say that and yeah the file says to compute the pagerank score twice second being the original algorithm
other: https i guess yeah yeah that is true with the original algorithm a page with no outgoing links should error out from what i’m seeing you have to delete these from your graph
me: yeah i guess so
other: https he used networkx here
me: a student responded to my question
other: hm that might have been the guy i talked to
me: okay and the prof said we gotta use our own code for gods sake
other: granted in the actual hw assignment it says nothing about visualization so i think adjacency matrix should be fine
me: for some reason i remember it saying lmao i know i know
other: lmaoooo
me: are you running the code locally
other: yeah i am adding a requirements.txt for people to run tho with the bucket being public it should be able to run from anywhere tho
me: aight bro my code is running for so long its ridiculous
other: damn some ppl used tqdm to show progress lmao
me: wtf ive never even heard of this thats wild
other: yeah it’s insne i’m gonna use it
me: aight my codes been running for 1.5 hours la lmao**
other: oooof im literally on my slides from undergrad
me: lmao
other: cause this is how common hierarchical is brought up in bioinformatics this is literally my lab work lol
me: this is free then i did this exactly a year ago too
other: yeah tbh im wondering why i came to lecture lol im waiting for him to go over upgma and to call it day lol
me: wtf is that i read that as sugma
other: average linkage basically lol sugma balls
me: mf npc ass
other: https this guy popped in my mind
me: wtf is this
other: lmaooooo npc ass watch it on your own time
me: fosho
other: wait so for 561 and the pagerank stuff for the first iteration what did you set the pagerank values to gotcha thanks
me: nw
other: yeah just need to do this otherwise im done using 100 files to test saved my life lol
me: i’m running my code and getting the division by 0 error lmao
other: idk what that dude is on with threadpoolexecutor oooof
me: i dont understand how literally makes no sense are u verifying with networkx you mind if we get on a zoom call in a bit to verify
other: not at the moment, but yeah i should
me: or later
other: yeah sure does like 7 work
me: yep
other: sounds good
me: some bs is going on in my bucket some files are blank
other: the fuck damn
me: yeah i try to open them and nothing
other: oooof
me: i deleted them and uploading again now
other: gotcha also do you mind jack and cindy hopping on the zoom
me: sure
other: bet

me: you can look up the particpations scores?
other: its based off the in class activities no ? cause how else does she have a record of us
me: probably maybe how active you were during discussions
other: hm true but if you are active during the second half i think she’ll prob give benefit of the doubt tbh have you started on cloud computing
me: she doesnt look strict as hell either we’ll see pretty much done i just need the code to get all 100,000 requests
other: gotcha yeah i’m just tryna get my stuff to just read from the database today as well do the 100k requests well i got the data from the database time to do the 100k requests
me: nice we going to the game ??

other: yeah that works

other: oh bet
me: we have more time than i thought btw thursday
other: oh
me: is the deadline
other: based thank fuck
me: yeah lmao and it looks like we should do them separately?
other: my 100k requests for 561 are running rn lmao i was gonna finish that today hm we should converge on some sources and then like maybe peer review so we don’t each get shafted i’m also gonna finish it off and get to office hours for her to review it
me: yeah sounds good bet i’ll do that too then
other: sounds good we can meet later in the week for that then xd imma just grind 561
me: yep sounds good lol
other: wait btw for prompts are you like focusing on racial and political bias
me: mostly political so far yeah what do you think
other: ok hm could you put these in a doc
me: sure
other: we could just work on em together then yeah good premises, we could add follow-ups and make some of these more specific we could also talk with alison during oo for feedback
me: sounds good shared ut it* i feel like there’s more room for analysis
other: bet
me: with the image generators
other: yeah ill look thru and add
me: than the textual models
other: that’s true yeah it’s gonna be a little non political with the textual ones i feel
me: yeah i can't make it say smth stupid like i saw someone ask about the israel palestine conflict online
other: that’s why maybe using followups would work but yeah
me: and it basically said that israel has a right to self-defense but for palestine it basically said  "its tricky" but now that i am testing it it just says both have the right and that its a highly debated, complex topic that depends on many factors
other: true but like you kinda have to edge it to make it pick one
me: i also shared a folder with you contains the results of my prompts on the models i’m trying out other text to image models they’re so ass
other: lmaoooo
me: i feel like i have good prompts for political bias if you have suggestions for prompts that can generate racial bias, lmk and i’ll test them and start writing a draft report thing
other: dude the pictures are lw fire i love how they were like yeah riot? french for the visual prompts, lets like add some stuff like “waiter” or “butler” or something like or "gangster"
me: thats good wya
other: we walkin over rn be there in 5

me: both of us should have 2-3 that the other did not review
other: kk i think rn we have 2 unique
me: thats fire
other: i can find one more for myself so we have 3 differences
me: great lets have mine be mostly about political bias and yours on racial or vice-versa
other: actually sure i can do racial
me: its all gonna go into one thing anyway
other: yee
me: lets just show that our task are distinct in some way
other: she also said to send like one example of a annotation to her if you wanted it reviewed, emailed her abt that ye
me: ah i see
other: yeee also just got some good sources for racial so we should be good
me: nice
other: imma try to get like 3-4 done before cloud computing so i can send to her and see what she says
me: so did she give u feedback on urs no ah gotchu lmk how that goes
other: bet
me: one citation left for me wbu? i’m done transferring my part to the doc
other: have 2 more will transfer then
me: bet
other: did a couple of my unique ones should be done in an hour or so
me: sounds good hows it going
other: yeah i got one more just finishing that one up rn the other two are there *on the doc
me: great
other: aight im done
me: bet gonna submit
other: sounds good did you change up my stuff a lil just so that it's not like blatant copying xd missed voice call
me: my b whats up
other: yeah was just gonna ask this xd
me: i can change it up sure
other: yee cause like she said we can’t have the same annotations we can have the same sources tho but like yk, we kinda got the summary and recommendations which is the main part just send me what you're submitting and i'll just make sure my shit looks different
me: bruh we cant have the same summaries?
other: yeah but i mean like, we got the gist of each paper which is like the hard part now it's just making sure it looks diff <this message was edited> "if you are working on your final project with a partner, you both should do the reading and independently create your bibliographies. you are welcome to share a list of papers to review, and to discuss the reading generally, but the annotations should be done independently. i also request that each partner have 2-3 papers that the other partner did not review."
me: gotchu
other: ye
me: all done sending in a bit
other: bet bet thanks yeah i’ll just make sure the common shit doesn’t look the same

me: okay
other: https
me: are you looking at the presentation lmaooo but this is kinda wrong harmon kardon is the default
other: true
me: burmeister or bowers and wilkins is the better option i kinda focused on my part but i guess its both of ours cuz you also tweaked the prompts
other: yeah honestly looks good ngl
me: add some parts that talk about the position paper and what it will include and we good
other: sounds good
me: yo what bias in visual models are u talking about or did u test on ur own?
other: oh u mean like from the results for the chatgpt ones i put i did on my own
me: i didnt find any bias in the image models
other: ah kk
me: like systemic not one off ah gotcha
other: can you change it to show like no depictions of violence
me: sure who’s taking what i can do background + methods you do the rest?
other: sure

other: lmao was there any update on that piazza post thing from 111
me: nope we have our staff meeting tmrw we’ll address it then probably
other: damn also just changed the position paper part on the presentation to general findings/research report since i doubt we’re gonna be able to stake a specific position on this stuff for gen ai given how centrist the responses were
me: yeah thats good we can say that our findings made us shift directions
other: yep
me: towards figuring out if ai models have become better at being unbiased did u make the change on the big slide deck? + for which we can create a timeline
other: sounds good
me: ^
other: oh wait yeah lemme make it on the big one
me: bet
other: yeah fixed we gucci
me: fosho

me: did u start the final report ???
other: oh yeah just made a doc lol, prob gonna get half done today-ish
me: okay i’ll start building my timeline today or tomorrow morning
other: sounds good, we can just use it as a figure for the paper then
me: yeah and i’ll write the accompanying discussion for it too for now start with just the introduction and previous work but if u wanna go even further into the test results and examples thats great
other: yee, also i’m gonna move the image/text results and the prompts into a folder called “supplementary materials" https did you get past the you dont have permissions to give permissions error
me: theres a service account that deployment manager uses give it the owner role u dont see it by default you go to service accounts and check show google provided roles/accounts on the right
other: ah do you gotta do that before you deploy the yaml
me: yeah did you say you wanted to meet with allison tmrw
other: tbh im gonna send her an email today to meet tuesday our final thing isnt due until thursday right
me: what time? i got two presentations on tuesday gonne have to be you gonna*
other: prob like afternoon-ish? like after class yeah thats good with me tbh
me: we gotta get started to show her smth if we’re seeing her before that
other: yeaaaaa im just tryna finish this cloud hw off rq and then work on that ill get it done its just yeah finals slog lol
me: bro what wtf is slog
other: grind
me: okay
other: finals grind** ye
me: you said you’ll start on thursday, and the document is still empty. im not saying you should have had the entire thing done, or even half, but at least something. i know we got a lot of other work, but we gonna get something going now. our thing is very fragmented rn. and i’m not saying only you work on the report, we obviously will work together but we divided tasks long ago do you wanna divide the report rn? i can take the methods, the results and create the timeline figures.
other: it is, i was just gonna grind most of it out today but so it’d be easier for us to get it done by monday, just tryna wrap a lot of things up last minute from my end yeah if you could take the results and timeline figures that would be great, i can finish off the rest since you worked the most with those
me: you got it
other: bet bruh i swear did allison not see our email at all
me: lol idk fyi i cant make that time
other: yeah i figured, ill just stay up and finish the report tn so we can just get it edited tmw i kinda wanna just finish off the edits tmw once she gives them to us and then submit ngl
me: you’re him
other: bro istg
me: do you need anything from me?
other: if the rest of my 701 group did their work i would have so much less shit to do its just me jack and will stressin on report rn lol
me: goddamn we got time till thursday
other: nah i got the methods and results so you good
me: you can just ask for pointers
other: for this ye
me: and i can give you what questions i have
other: yeah that's what i was gonna do mainly sure thing just list em out here or on the doc
me: gotchu so essentially if you could show her our results like the most representative examples and ask if she thinks this is robuts enough and that i was thinking of a quantitative approach - calculating polarity scores of text responses on trump vs biden for example
other: ah yeah we could ask that good point
me: so we’d have a qualitative and a quantitative approach
other: yep could we potentially use sentiment as well and also can we make a github repo for all of this too instead of gdrive
me: sure
other: sounds good
me: i’m adding more tests to the drtive drive* thats what i was talking about examine the positive or negative sentiment of a given response to a prompt also you say "medical advice based on race" i'm not sure what that means lmao cuz we got no prompts like that
other: oh yeah true i guess like i could just make that more into the previous work where like “oh it’s been shown to have bias in other fields so we were interested in bias in general” kinda thing
me: sure you do you gango
other: bet also how did we do
me: y’all did great
other: ayyy thanks
me: yo theres one more ishan
other: yeah
me: lmao
other: hes the polar opposite to me im just a little memey guy this dude is tall af and looks serious af
me: lmao
other: ok yeah also looks we should do sentiment or bias analysis too like these guys didd for text at least ok hm this is fire
me: it really is lmao
other: lmao all that to get asked the same questions as us
me: thats wild lmao and we got like 4 questions
other: frfr
me: like that fr fr so for the report are you gonna work on it later today? i wanted to say smth about the findings we can do this
other: yeah
me: you can write like a skeleton of our findings high level overview i can do more testing get more results and do the polarity score thing and we can update accordingly
other: true
me: gpt 4 is actually a g refuses to give an opinion ever goddamn
other: damn
me: bro we both procrastinated so much on this project we could have a much easier time right now but as you know, fuck it we ball
other: lmao fr
me: so i added what chatgpt outputted its not ideal you can go ahead and just edit it now, making smooth transitions
other: sounds goo d
me: be sure to mention the authors’ methods a lot and how they relate to our methodology
other: bet, could you also just like bullet point out the main findings and then ill just put them and edit into paragraph form
me: you can find those in the bibliographies
other: from there i can write discussion no i meant the one under methods
me: oh our findings you gotit you mind if i do that by tonight im thinking of doing more testing to make this shit more robust
other: yeah that’s fine https bruh damn this racial bias filter is good scroll down to the last few https i got it to be racist massive w we’re so fucking using this lol
me: lmaooo this is all you my guy oh maybe we could have these approaches 1. normal prompts
other: yeah like the super informal talk yeah
me: 2. role playing those two thats fire what time are we meeting allison tmrw?
other: like 2
me: oh shit aight bet thats good actually gives us more time
other: yeah bruh i cant get it to go on political bias looks like the biden trump shit is right yeah no dice with political bias even with other figures it just stopped role playing
me: okay gotchu this is hella nice
other: ye
me: i like this any other role playing scenarios if you can get like 5 in total that’d be amazing i think
other: bet imma try ill write the report without those but if i can get em i will put em in
me: bet yo i was working on smth else this evening anything you need from me or smth you’d like me to take over
other: i got it is it the 701 report lol i’m working on that rn haha
me: nah my research
other: aaah gotcha
me: professor wanted some last minute changes lmao
other: it be like that
me: ong goddamn chatgpt just cant budge about politic s same with bard
other: yeahhh i just put that down as a nogo in the content analysis part
me: im imitating another researcher’s method text completion “i am a republican, in the next election i will be voting for..." “abortion should be ..." would not budge yeah make sure you mention the approaches we tried our prompts, role playing, text completion i also gave it a political spectrum quiz, same thing https also, we meeting allison today?
other: yeah at like 2
me: gotchu i gotta meet my research professor at 2
other: gotcha, yeah i think she said anytime during office hours was good which means like 2 so we can just do 2
me: gotchu yo stability ai wildin cant lie got some spicy results
other: damn
me: iamges images yeah the only argument i have for bias in images is that it is just us centric for strictly political prompts the popular ones, chatgpt, stable diffusion and dall-e 2
other: yeah i think we can mention that let’s ask her abt it tho
me: still with my prof are you there rn?
other: i’m almost there will prob be there at like 2
me: okay are u with her

other: otherwise we good
me: so leave that part blank i’ll fill in later

other: you see our report wwwwww only gripe i have with is that like, she said we didn’t define bias when we did im not sure if that’s worth a regrade request since we got a 19/21

other: yeahh oh did she submit grades or did you do your own calculations
me: she submitted
other: yeah i mean i got b but like i dont think that was cause of final project
